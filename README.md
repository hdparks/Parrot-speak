# Parrot-speak
Reads in quotes from a file, produces similar sentences. (Implements a Markov Chain)

To create your own parrot, collect a list of quotes from a person (or persons). 
Prepare a simple .txt file with a single quote/sentence per line.
Train your new parrot by running parrot-speak.py in the same directory as your .txt file.
Pass in the name of your file to the Parrot constructor. (ex. polly = parrot_speak.Parrot('my_file.txt'))

Call speak() several times on your Parrot to see what it has to say!
